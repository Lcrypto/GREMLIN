If you have a x86_64 Linux, you can use the pre-compiled version in this directory!

1) download and install the MCR: http://www.mathworks.com/supportfiles/MCR_Runtime/R2012a/MCR_R2012a_glnxa64_installer.zip
2) ./run_gremlin.sh ~/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v717 1whzA.id90cov82.cut.msa 1whzA.id90cov82.cut.apc verbose 1

the "~/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v717" is the MCR from the above installation

## UPDATE SEP 03, 2016 ##
The output apc file is length x length matrix of apc(l2norm(20x20 coupling matrix))

The value depends on number of sequences, diversity of sequence, length and number of iterations. Hence they should only be used for relative ranking.
There is no simple way to standardize the values, given they are not normally distributed (sometimes skewed, sometime multimodal, depending on protein family)

We made an attempt to standardize the values using statistics from the entire PDB:
http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e09248v2/figure16

In short:
1) We compute the neff (effective number of sequences at reweight 0.20, this value is reported when gremlin is first run).
2) We take the top 1.5xLENGTH contacts with sequence seperation >= 3. The values are then rescales so that the minimum is 0.5 and the average is at 1.0.
3) Using this scaled GREMLIN score and neff/sqrt(LENGTH) we find we can predicted the probability of contact.

## UPDATE FEB 24, 2016 ##
We've added an option to output the MRF model:
./run_gremlin.sh ~/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v717/ 1whzA.id90cov82.cut.msa 1whzA.id90cov82.cut.apc verbose 1 save_model 1whzA.id90cov82.cut.model

the order of the amino acids: ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV-
if the row contains 21 values: these are part of the conservation vector (20 amino acids + 1 gap)
if the row contains 443 values: these are part of the coupling matrix (i,j,21x21)
